    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        Hi there! I'm Yash Patil, an aspiring web developer passionate about building beautiful, user-friendly websites. 
        Although I'm just starting out in my development career, I bring a creative eye and problem-solving skills gained from my background in photography and love of the outdoors.
        <br>
        Ever since I can remember, I've spent my free time with a camera in hand, capturing stunning landscapes on hiking trails near my home. 
        The satisfaction of getting that perfect shot fuels my drive to craft every detail of a web project carefully. 
        My photography <a href="">portfolio</a> showcases my keen attention to composition, lighting, and emotion.
        As a web developer, I specialize in creating responsive, modern websites optimised for today's browsers. I'm proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python - Flask, with experience in wireframing, prototyping, and testing designs. Although I'm in the early stages of my career, I'm dedicated to continuously improving through self-study, collaborating with experienced developers, and staying on top of emerging trends.
        In my next role, I'm excited to join a dynamic team where I can contribute my skills while expanding my technical knowledge. I love bringing clients' visions to life online. Let's connect if you're looking for a motivated, creative developer to add value to your projects and company.
